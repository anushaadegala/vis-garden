                                <p>The main goal of this project is to provide a visualization of data representing U.S. exports and imports through which an individual can interact with, investigate, and ultimately learn more about goods and services being shipped from the U.S. to foreign countries and vice versa. As a part of this, we accessed foreign trade data from United States census.gov website. With prior and extended knowledge on D3.js, we have written code to draw the U.S. state map and other associated charts that are both interactive and even a little fun. </p>

                                        <li>As a first step in the design process, we understood all the requirements of this project and then planned to come up with a layout of our webpage. Finally, after undergoing pros and cons of every design and chart type, and taking  time constraint into consideration, we came up with the following layout.</li>
                                        <li>The layout consists of checkboxes for years from 2013-2016 and radio buttons for trading options (imports and exports) followed by countries and commodities. And then we have radio buttons for first layer and second layer. First layer: where we can view small picture of the countries based on region in the world , and Second layer: where we can view the "big picture" of all countries in every region.</li>
                                        <li>Then we have a state map with tooltip functionality of the United States including Alaska and Hawaii but excluding territories such as Puerto Rico and District of Columbia. Subsequently, when a user clicks on a particular state after choosing the options from checkboxes and radio buttons, a pie chart will be displayed showing either the countries or commodities based on the amount of imports and exports. At the bottom of the page, we have two charts, bar chart and pie chart (we wanted a line chart, too, but ran out of time), that are interactive with one another and give a clearer idea on U.S. foreign trade from the years 2013-2016.</li>
                                        <li>We kept changing the layout and data structure either because we figured out what we wanted is not logical or new ideas occurred to us. For example, regarding the fun part, we wanted to implement a 'pac-man' to, for instance, provide a walkthrough from the most amount of exports to the least amount.</li>

                                        <li><strong>About the color: </strong>All colors in this project were used with the help of Color Brewer and tested with Color Oracle. For example,  while we are working on the map, we used red color to be filled in the states on mouseover and Green text color for the state code names. But when we checked with color oracle tool to see if our map works for people with colorblindness, it did not work for one of the three types. Then we tried with other different colors and came up with #FFE333 which is near-yellow in color.</li>
                                        <li><strong>About the data structure: </strong>We tried and gave up some structures which we wanted to use for this project, although we had tried it for four days in a row, including over Fall Break. It isn’t a Fall Break for us, but this project ‘broke our hearts.’ One reason we spent so much time on a data structure we didn’t use is because of d3.js limitations. We thought about creating functions which provide data to feed charts and we could use these functions repeatedly. However, we were wrong. The only one way to get data is to retrieve data while building charts. That is to say, we should build data, for example, in an array every time we created charts. That’s probably because of the order of execution of d3.js. Moreover, another thing we tried for fetching data from csv files is we reduced data, leaving only 3 states, in order to validate whether we got the right number from those files.</li>

                                        <li><strong>What we discovered: </strong> Not surprisingly, our biggest source of imports and exports for each year was China, with Canada and Mexico not far behind. It makes sense that we'd be trading often with our neighboring countries (consider our role in NAFTA); it also makes sense for us to be dealing often with a fellow superpower, China, which has a large population and various cheap manufacturing plants. Our biggest exports fit the expectation one might have an industrialized nation; that is to say, our top exports are either highly manufactured (such as transportation), mineral resources, 'machinery and electrical,' and 'chemicals and allied industries.' It's also worth mentioning that 'Vegetable Products' made its way into the top six of our biggest exports--this might well too be expected, knowing that the efficiency of farms continues to rely on machinery or genetically modified products. Our biggest exports all require a skilled work force and access to resources.Funny enough, these also happened to be our highest imports, as well. It also bears mentioning that the one country that didn't make the top exports but did make the top imports was Saudi Arabia, which we're guessing is mineral/oil related. And as one might expect, our biggest states/coastal states were the biggest importers and exporters--this includes California, Texas, and New York.</li>
